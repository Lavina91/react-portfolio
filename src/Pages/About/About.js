                                I moved to Denver, Colorado at the beginning of 2020 to start a new chapter of my life and experience a different city.
                                I â€˜ve worked as a bartender for 8 years and had most of my time behind craft cocktail bars. However, with COVID -19, it has opened my eyes to what jobs have stability and which ones do not.
                                I am currently attending Denver University Coding Bootcamp and hope to begin a new chapter in my career life in Web Development.

                                <br />
                                Some hobbies that I love to indulge in is gardening, playing video games and cooking or coming up with fun and delicious cocktails.
                                Some of my favorite plants that I have had the opportunity to grow include, passionfruit, mint and shishito peppers.
                                The one video game that I love and put a lot of hours into is called Ghost of Tsushima.
                                And my favorite dishes to make is Boliche ( a Cuban styled stuffed pot roast) and my favorite cocktail would have to be a Zombie.
